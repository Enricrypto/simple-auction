Simple Auction Contract - Solidity 
This repository contains a Simple Auction Contract written in Solidity. The contract allows users to participate in a decentralized auction where the highest bid wins. Key features include tracking the highest bidder and their bid, ensuring safe withdrawals for outbid participants, and concluding the auction after a specified time period.

# Features
Highest Bidder and Bid: Tracks the highest bid and bidder in real-time. Users can place bids that exceed the current highest bid.
Auction Duration: The auction runs for a specified period (in minutes) from the contract’s creation.
End of Auction: When the auction ends, the highest bid is transferred to the beneficiary.
Safe Withdrawals: Outbid participants can safely withdraw their bids to avoid losing funds.

# Contract Details
Beneficiary: The address that receives the highest bid after the auction ends.
End Time: The auction runs until a predefined time based on the contract’s creation.
Highest Bid/Bidder: Continuously updated as new, higher bids are placed.
Auction End: Once the auction ends, the highest bid is transferred to the beneficiary, and no further bids can be placed.

# Events
NewBid: Triggered every time a new highest bid is placed.
AuctionEnded: Triggered once the auction ends and the winner is declared.

# Functions
bid(): Place a new bid. The bid must be higher than the current highest bid.
withdraw(): Allows outbid users to withdraw their previous bids safely.
auctionEnd(): Ends the auction and transfers the highest bid to the beneficiary.
